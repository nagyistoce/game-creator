Game Creator is an open-source clone of Game Maker. The goal is for the IDE to be compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac, and to create games for a variety of different platforms, such as the iPhone, Zune, XBox 360, as well as the development platforms themselves. Game Creator aims for 99.9% compatibility with Game Maker, for minimal changes to ported games. A specification will be written to keep incompatibilities of runtime environments across different platforms to a minimum.

**UPDATE 7/23/13:** For the first time in 4 years, the long-awaited source code is available! I had some extra time and spent part of the past 2 weeks revisiting this project and rewriting the code base, because it needed to be done. Note that the IDE is also available in the source.

**Latest updates:**
  * Completed a .NET compiler backend/JIT engine
  * Started building an optionally obfuscating JavaScript backend
  * Rewrote and modularized everything
  * Separated the interpreter from the runtime library and parser
  * Sped up the interpreter with JITed variable access
  * Added a GML generator with a custom formatter
  * ... and more.

**Technologies Currently Used**
  * **.NET Framework/Mono Runtime**
> > The IDE is written in C#, which is native to Windows and can be easily
> > ported to Linux and Mac OS.
  * **OpenTK**
> > OpenTK is a multiplatform graphics (gl) and audio API, used for games that target
> > the .NET framework.
  * **JavaScript**
> > The JavaScript backend to the GML compiler optionally obfuscates and
> > minifies your code, allowing you to publish your game on the web with HTML5.
  * **Abstract Syntax Tree**
> > The GML compiler builds a tree based on the structure of the GML code.
> > When interpreted, the system executes lambdas for each expression node.
> > The API has some potential. It will let you build a syntax tree, optimize it, and
> > output the optimized GML.
  * **System.Reflection.Emit**
> > This is used to generate .NET executables, in a backend to the GML compiler.
> > Assemblies are created with the AssemblyBuilder class. For JIT, the lightweight
> > DynamicMethod class is used instead of AssemblyBuilder.
> > System.Linq.Expressions is another core part of the .NET framework that uses
> > DynamicMethod internally. Game Creator uses this in interpreted games to create
> > delegates that access object properties from GML. It can also be used to build
> > an expression tree directly from a lambda, which is featured in the JavaScript compiler
> > by making use of ExpressionVisitor.
  * **Dynamic Runtime**
> > GML is a dynamic, interpreted language by nature. In cases where types or names
> > are not known at compile time, Game Creator includes a dynamic runtime for accessing
> > those variables and objects. This will ensure that your game is fully compatible
> > and supported when imported from GameMaker.

**Technologies Not Used Yet**
  * **LLVM**
> > LLVM is a compiler infrastructure I'm planning on using as a backend to the
> > GML compiler. This would make compiled GML ultra fast and ultra portable. It
> > would also make writing runtimes for new platforms a breeze, because they can
> > be written in any language and linked with LLVM output files. It would also
> > make writing export modules easier, due to the creation of an LLVM export interface.
  * **MonoGame**
> > MonoGame is a good option because it targets many more platforms than OpenTK, though
> > MonoGame uses it internally. It's actually the open-source equivalent of Microsoft XNA,
> > and targets iOS, Android, XBox, and more.
  * **Plugin Interface**
> > Support is planned for extensiblity by using Export Modules. Once an export module
> > is plugged in, you will be able to export your game to any platform supported
> > by the open-source community.
  * **Line-level debugging**
> > I have hopes of plugging in a line debugger with breakpoints that allows you to
> > inspect values at runtime. There is support with the ICorDebug interface, and
> > System.Diagnostics.Debugger.

I started this project in June of 2008 as a hobby, and I worked on it briefly from 2008 to 2009.

The latest snapshot of Game Creator (09/2009) is available as a download in .zip format. It's provided AS IS, as a preview. It's pretty unstable since not much has been implemented yet, but definitely go ahead and try it out. Click [here](http://game-creator.googlecode.com/files/snapshot_bin2.zip) to download.

I have a few ideas for improvement.

  1. Build a GML analyzer for building efficient compiled code
  1. Use an abstract syntax tree to represent the game, to be compiled on any platform
  1. Build an interface for using a desired middle layer, i.e. [LLVM](http://llvm.org) or [Microsoft CCI](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/cci/)
  1. Other back ends can then be used ([OpenTK](http://www.opentk.com/), [GTKSharp](http://www.mono-project.com/GtkSharp), [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten)+[WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) for HTML5, [XNA](http://create.msdn.com/en-US/), etc., etc.)

Note that as of late, these ideas are already being implemented.
